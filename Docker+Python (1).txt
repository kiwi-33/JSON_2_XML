Task:
Write a python script, which will convert json files to xml files, encrypt and transfer it in a remote location.

Environment:

Description:
Solution should be prepared as two Docker images, 1st to send files, and 2nd to receive them.
Deployment of these containers should be automated using docker-compose or shell script.
